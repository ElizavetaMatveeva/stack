# stack
Array-based stack that solves the problem of verifying whether a sequence of different types of brackets is written in the correct order

## Implemented stack methods:
- push
- pop
- top
- empty
- full
- printStk
- reset
 
## Problem that had to be solved:  
Check whether a sequence of opening and closing brackets (e.g. " ({[]])) ") is written in the correct order, that is, every opening bracket has a matching closing bracket and both are located in the same "layer" of the expression. 
If order is not correct, print a message explaining the reason (brackets don't match / extra brackets in the sequence / missing matching bracket) and specify which position causes the problem.
